Here is a review of the remaining REST routes and suggestions for nesting similar to how `SpeechProviderVoices` is nested under `SpeechProviders` to make the API more intuitive and organized:

### SpeechProviders and SpeechProviderVoices

- Since `SpeechProviderVoices` are related to `SpeechProviders` (via `ProviderId`), it makes sense to nest them under `SpeechProviders`:

  - **GET** `/speech-providers` - Get all speech providers
  - **GET** `/speech-providers/{providerId}` - Get a specific speech provider
  - **POST** `/speech-providers` - Create a new speech provider
  - **PUT** `/speech-providers/{providerId}` - Update a specific speech provider
  - **DELETE** `/speech-providers/{providerId}` - Delete a specific speech provider
  - **GET** `/speech-providers/{providerId}/voices` - Get all voices for a specific speech provider
  - **GET** `/speech-providers/{providerId}/voices/{voiceId}` - Get a specific speech provider voice
  - **POST** `/speech-providers/{providerId}/voices` - Create a new voice for a specific speech provider
  - **PUT** `/speech-providers/{providerId}/voices/{voiceId}` - Update a specific speech provider voice
  - **DELETE** `/speech-providers/{providerId}/voices/{voiceId}` - Delete a specific speech provider voice

### SpeechProfiles and SpeechProviders

- Since `SpeechProfiles` use `SpeechProviders` (via `SpeechProviderId`), they do not need to be nested under `SpeechProviders`. The original CRUD routes for `SpeechProfiles` can remain as-is:

  - **GET** `/speech-profiles` - Get all speech profiles
  - **GET** `/speech-profiles/{profileId}` - Get a specific speech profile
  - **POST** `/speech-profiles` - Create a new speech profile
  - **PUT** `/speech-profiles/{profileId}` - Update a specific speech profile
  - **DELETE** `/speech-profiles/{profileId}` - Delete a specific speech profile

### Projects and Related Resources

- `Projects` are related to `SpeechProfiles`, `Sources`, and `CompositionProfiles`. Nesting the routes can make accessing related information more consistent.

  - **GET** `/projects` - Get all projects
  - **GET** `/projects/{projectId}` - Get a specific project
  - **POST** `/projects` - Create a new project
  - **PUT** `/projects/{projectId}` - Update a specific project
  - **DELETE** `/projects/{projectId}` - Delete a specific project

- Since `Projects` are also related to `Sources`

  - **GET** `/projects/{projectId}/sources`
  - **POST** `/projects/{projectId}/sources`
  - **GET** `/projects/{projectId}/sources/{sourceId}`

- Generation jobs
  - **POST** `/projects/{projectId}/generate` - create generation job
  - **GET** `/projects/{projectId}/generate/{jobId}`

### AudioChunks and Projects

- Since `AudioChunks` are related to `Projects` (via `ProjectId`), it is logical to nest them under `Projects`:

  - **GET** `/projects/{projectId}/audio-chunks` - Get all audio chunks for a specific project
  - **GET** `/projects/{projectId}/audio-chunks/{chunkId}` - Get a specific audio chunk
  - **POST** `/projects/{projectId}/audio-chunks` - Create a new audio chunk for a specific project
  - **PUT** `/projects/{projectId}/audio-chunks/{chunkId}` - Update a specific audio chunk
  - **DELETE** `/projects/{projectId}/audio-chunks/{chunkId}` - Delete a specific audio chunk

### CompositionProfiles

- `CompositionProfiles` might not have an obvious parent entity apart from `Projects`. The original CRUD routes for `CompositionProfiles` can remain as-is:

  - **GET** `/composition-profiles` - Get all composition profiles
  - **GET** `/composition-profiles/{id}` - Get a specific composition profile
  - **POST** `/composition-profiles` - Create a new composition profile
  - **PUT** `/composition-profiles/{id}` - Update a specific composition profile
  - **DELETE** `/composition-profiles/{id}` - Delete a specific composition profile

### Summary

Nesting the routes where a parent-child relationship exists helps to provide better context and organization to the API. It makes it easier to understand the relationships between entities, as well as provides a clearer and more intuitive structure for the end users of the API.
